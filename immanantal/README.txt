codist enumerates the spectra.

check checks that the two iso-distance-spectral trees bm1 and bm2 have
the exchange property.

dist_poly1.txt and dist_poly2.txt are the characteristic polynomials
of the four matrices in the paper, lemma 4.

coimm_pairs.tre-- pairs of coimmanantal trees
n_spectra_results/spectra_profile.out-- how the spectra break down into coimmanantal sets
n_spectra_results/n_spectra.out-- the number of spectra
